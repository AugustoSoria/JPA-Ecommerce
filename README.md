# JPA E-Commerce Project
![Badge in Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-IN%20DEVELOPMENT-green)

I made this E-Commerce project that uses JPA specifications to filter the entire data.

## Project Description

I worked on this little project in my free time to practice my skills with JPA specifications. I picked an e-commerce theme because it's a project type where you can add many features and watch it grow. So whenever I want to practice something new, I just think of a feature to add to this project. 
Like, for example, figuring out how to exclude certain results, like a specific car model, from the listings.
The project uses JPA specifications to filter each product and also to count the number of products based on different filters and criteria.

## Test Project

You can run it using Docker.

First you have to set a MySQL user and password in the docker-compose.yml file, these user and password values must be the same than the user and password values in the application.properties file. Next you have to start Docker in your pc, finally you have to run the command "docker compose up" into the folder /jpaEcommerceServer and Docker will take care of everything for you, so no need to install anything else!
